```

To edit my config file, I used vim and pasted the following code in:

```Host cse
    HostName ieng6.ucsd.edu
    User cs15lsp22zzz (use your username)
```

I got this code from the lab 5 writeup.

I typed `ssh cse` with `cse` replacing the old `cs15lsp22anq@ieng6.ucsd.edu`.

I used the scp command to move a new file I created into the cse15l-lab-reports directory of the ieng6 server. This is the aforementioned command: `scp labreport3.txt cse:~/cse15l-lab-reports`.

## Setup Github Access from ieng6

After making the public key on my local computer, I copied the contents in the public key file and pasted it into a new ssh key in github.

After using the `ssh-keygen` command during which I made a id_rsa_github file, I got the private key file in my .ssh directory.

I ran into problems trying to push the commits I made as I was still prompted to type in my username and password even after setting up the tokens. To fix this problem I looked at Stack Overflow and found this command that fixed the problem.
`git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<Username>/<Project>.git`

This link points to my commit history for this lab report since I git pushed my changes I made to this file through my local computer terminal. Very meta. I attached another image of me doing it again down below.

## Copy whole directories with `scp -r`

This is the command for copying my whole markdown-parser directory to my ieng6 account: `scp -r . cse:~/markdown-parse`. The command output was very long, which prompted me to take 4 screenshots to capture it all.

After ssh-ing into the server, I cd'd into the markdown-parse directory and ran the following files:

`javac -cp lib/junit-4.12.jar:libs/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:. MarkdownParseTest.java`

`java -cp lib/junit-4.12.jar:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:. org.junit.runner.JUnitCore MarkdownParseTest`.
