[Failure-inducing input file](https://github.com/MichaelYe48/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-file2.md)

The bug in my code was the failure to address possible failure inducing inputs, such as a file with an extra line at the end. This failure inducing input changes one of my variables in the while loop to -1. My while loop cannot terminate when the variables inside are negative, which causes my program to have an infinite loop and cause the "OutOfMemoryError" runtime exception.
